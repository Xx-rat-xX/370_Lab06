Main Game: There are various things to interact with, like the door, light, and FX cubes. If you click the green cube with the boo label, the main game will start. To win, hit all three buttons that are scattered around the area. Once all three buttons are hit, the game will end and you will receive a score. Score: +1 to send boo back (click him), -5 if hit by boo
